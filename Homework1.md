### Question 1> Define the term essential difficulties as it is used by Brooks. Provide background and context with your answer and at least one example of an essential difficulty.

### Answer:

Brooks analyzes the problems in software engineering in the paper, "No Silver Bullet: Essence and Accidents of Software Engineering". He then goes on to categorise them into two ctegories, essential difficulties and accidental difficulties. He defines essential difficulties as the difficulties that are inherent in the nature of software.

He explains that a software is a complex system with many "interlocking concepts", like, data sets, relationships among data items, algorithms, and invocations of functions. This lends every piece of software a unique yet abstract identity. He explains that many elements of a software maybe similar to another software, yet the outcome of the amalgamation of that unique combination yields a unique identity for every software.

Brooks explains that the hard part of building software is the specification, design and testing of the conceptual construct in the software. He explains that errors due to humane mistakes like syntactitcal error or other "accidental errors" are "fuzz" compared with the conceptual or essential errors in most systems.

This is the reason he believes that building a software will always be very difficult and there is "No Silver Bullet" to solve these problems.

Examples: Due to "invisibility", a client might want a product that is very difficult to implement. For this example let us consider a product that needs language modelling abilities using recurring neural networks. The client thinks modeling a language is very easy and is willing to pay a fraction of the cost of the product (as the client does not understand the underelying "complexity" of the product he wants).
